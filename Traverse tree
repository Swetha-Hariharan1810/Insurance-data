Key Workflow:
Get Possible Edges and to_node Texts:

Retrieve all possible edges for the current node and fetch the to_node texts corresponding to the edges.
LLM to Generate Options or Actions:

Use the to_node texts to let the LLM generate possible options or actions for the user.
Match the Transcript with Edge Criteria:

Use the LLM to match the transcript segment with the edge criteria or generated options.
Transition to the Next Node:

If a matching edge is found, transition to the corresponding to_nodeid.



Get Possible Edges and to_node Texts:

Retrieves possible edges for the current node and fetches the to_node_text for each edge.
LLM Generates Options:

Based on the to_node texts, the LLM generates actionable options or next steps for the user.
LLM Matches Transcript:

The transcript segment is matched to the edge criteria using an LLM, which determines the best edge for transition.
Transition to the Next Node:

If a match is found, the current node transitions to the next node (to_nodeid). Otherwise, the system waits for more transcript context.
This code provides options for next actions while maintaining flexibility to determine the next node based on transcript input.
